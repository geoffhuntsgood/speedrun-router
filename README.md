# Speedrun Router

A simple app that allows for selection of speedrun routes that I use or am interested in using. Hosted at https://geoffhuntsgood.com/speedrun-router.

Each route links to its respective documentation (or, in some cases, the route video).

There is also an option to upload a .txt file for custom routes formatted in the same way (with some restrictions).

Once in a route, collectibles are displayed on the right. The route can be navigated by scrolling or by jumping to headers by pressing the left and right arrow keys.

The current routes included are for:

- Donkey Kong 64
- Donkey Kong 64 Category Extensions
- Donkey Kong Bananza
- Donkey Kong Bananza Category Extensions
- Yooka-Replaylee
