# Speedrun Router

A simple app that allows for selection of speedrun routes that I use or am interested in using.

Each route links to its respective documentation (or, in some cases, the route video).

There is also an option to upload a .txt file for custom routes formatted in the same way (with some restrictions).

The current routes included are for:

- Donkey Kong 64
- Donkey Kong 64 Category Extensions
- Donkey Kong Bananza
- Donkey Kong Bananza Category Extensions
- Yooka-Replaylee
